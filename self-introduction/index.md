 Hello. My name is Rinat Ilyasov. I'm 36 years old. By education, an engineer is a designer. But at the very beginning of my path to mechanical engineering, I studied information technologies for 3 years. In the profession I could not find a job. After the army, I worked in ordinary positions : locksmith, machine operator. After I went to the university in absentia. In the end, I moved to the engine designer.

    I was always interested in programming. My programming way has been starting with Pascal (I studied in college). Today I have the following results. The basics of the HTML, the CSS are passed in various courses (code-basics.com, freecodecamp.org). I have English B1 certificate (Anglia Certificate B1). The process of studying JavaScript includes reading a Ilya Kantor book (learn.javascript.ru) and viewing webinars. When working on the Sheltor project, there were no problems with layout, it was interesting to apply the SASS, but there was not enough time, the main difficulty was a Javascript.

    My personal skills such as: responsibility, stress resistance, sociability, initiative, quick learning, skill work in the team, focus on the result.

  In general, my task is to get all the necessary skills to become a professional programmer engineer in the field of web development. 

In my free time, I spend reading books, watching films, fishing or going on a hike. That's all . Thank you for watching.
